# RAML - RESTful API Modeling Language.
Raml is a Restful API Modeling language. It makes it easy to manage the whole API lifecycle from design to sharing. It is concise. You only write what you need to define and reusable. It is the best way of describing practically-RESTful API’s in a way that’s highly readable by both humans and computers. There are many advantages to taking an API-first development approach and with the help of modern tools like RAML, API’s have become more elastic and easier to use. 

### Prerequisite: 
How the restful API’s operate, how to send the requests, and response, and how to specify the components. Also have a good understanding of 4 most common HTTP verbs:

#### What is HTTP METHODS?
HTTP defines a set of request methods to indicate the desired action to be performed for a given resource. There are several Http Requests that can be used while creating a web service.
1. <strong> GET </strong> method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only retrieve data.
2. <strong> POST </strong> method is used to submit an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server.
3. <strong> PUT </strong> method replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload.
4. <strong> DELETE </strong> method deletes the specified resource.
